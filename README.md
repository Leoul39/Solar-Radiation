## Project Overview

This project analyzes environmental measurements to uncover trends and insights regarding solar radiation. The primary goals are:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the irradiance factors affecting solar energy potential.
- Statistical Analysis: Identifying patterns in solar radiation data.
- Strategy Development: Recommending optimal regions for solar installations in Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo.

An interactive Streamlit app was developed to visualize and explore the data dynamically.

## Technologies Used

The analysis and visualizations were performed using:
- Python Libraries:
  - pandas for data manipulation
  - matplotlib and seaborn for static visualizations
  - plotly for interactive visualizations
- Streamlit: For building the interactive application
- Jupyter Notebook: For EDA and in-depth analysis

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Leoul39/Solar-Radiation.git
cd Solar-Radiation
```
### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Streamlit App
streamlit run app/app.py

## Analysis and Insights

The analysis revealed key trends:
1. High Solar Irradiance Regions:
   - Benin: Coastal areas show consistent solar irradiance, ideal for installations.
   - Sierra Leone: Inland regions have significant solar potential despite seasonal variations.
   - Togo: Northern regions experience high irradiance with minimal cloud cover.
2. Seasonal Variations:
   - All three countries show distinct seasonal patterns that affect solar efficiency.
   - Dry seasons generally exhibit higher solar potential than wet seasons.
